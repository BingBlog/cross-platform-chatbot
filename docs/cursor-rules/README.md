# Cursor Rules Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains detailed documentation for the Cursor Rules defined in the main `.cursorrules` file. These documents provide comprehensive guidelines for specific development areas.

## Files

- `README.md` - This file, providing overview and navigation
- `architecture-rules.md` - Detailed architectural guidelines and patterns
- `coding-standards.md` - Comprehensive coding standards and best practices
- `platform-rules.md` - Platform-specific development rules
- `backend-development.md` - Backend development guidelines and patterns
- `ai-integration.md` - AI integration and streaming response guidelines
- `testing-guidelines.md` - Testing strategies and best practices

## Usage

The main `.cursorrules` file contains the essential rules that Cursor needs to understand the project. These supplementary documents provide detailed guidance for specific development areas.

## Document Structure

### Core Architecture
- **architecture-rules.md** - 6-layer architecture, design patterns, data flow
- **platform-rules.md** - Cross-platform development, adapters, platform-specific code

### Development Standards
- **coding-standards.md** - TypeScript, linting, code organization, naming conventions
- **backend-development.md** - Controller/Service patterns, API design, database integration
- **ai-integration.md** - QWEN API, streaming responses, conversation management

### Quality Assurance
- **testing-guidelines.md** - Unit, integration, E2E testing strategies and examples

## Best Practices

1. **Reference when needed**: Use these documents as reference materials during development
2. **Keep updated**: Update documentation when patterns or standards change
3. **Follow consistently**: Apply the guidelines consistently across all development work
4. **Team alignment**: Ensure all team members understand and follow these standards

## Quick Reference

### For New Developers
1. Start with `architecture-rules.md` to understand the system design
2. Review `coding-standards.md` for development practices
3. Check `platform-rules.md` for cross-platform considerations

### For Backend Development
1. Follow `backend-development.md` for service and controller patterns
2. Use `ai-integration.md` for AI-related features
3. Apply `testing-guidelines.md` for comprehensive testing

### For Frontend Development
1. Review `platform-rules.md` for platform-specific considerations
2. Follow `coding-standards.md` for component development
3. Use `testing-guidelines.md` for component testing

Remember: These documents complement the main `.cursorrules` file and provide detailed guidance for specific development scenarios. Always refer to the main rules file first, then consult these documents for detailed implementation guidance.
