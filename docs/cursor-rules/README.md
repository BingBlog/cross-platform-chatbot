# Cursor Rules Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains additional documentation for the Cursor Rules defined in the main `.cursorrules` file.

## Files

- `README.md` - This file, providing overview and navigation
- `architecture-rules.md` - Detailed architectural guidelines (if needed)
- `coding-standards.md` - Detailed coding standards (if needed)
- `platform-rules.md` - Platform-specific rules (if needed)

## Usage

The main `.cursorrules` file contains the essential rules that Cursor needs to understand the project. Additional detailed documentation can be added here as needed, but should be kept minimal to avoid overwhelming the AI assistant.

## Best Practices for Cursor Rules

1. **Keep it concise**: Cursor Rules should be easy to scan and understand
2. **Focus on essentials**: Include only the most important rules and patterns
3. **Use clear structure**: Organize rules logically with clear headings
4. **Avoid redundancy**: Don't repeat information unnecessarily
5. **Update regularly**: Keep rules current with project evolution

## When to Add Detailed Documentation

Add detailed documentation files only when:

- The main rules file becomes too long (>200 lines)
- Specific domains need extensive guidelines
- Team members need reference materials
- Complex patterns need detailed explanations

Remember: The goal is to help Cursor understand the project quickly and accurately, not to create comprehensive documentation.
