# Coding Standards

## Overview

This document outlines the coding standards approach for the Cross-Platform AI Chatbot project. Specific coding rules are enforced through linting tools rather than being listed here.

## Linting Strategy

### Primary Tools

- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript code quality
- **Prettier**: Code formatting consistency
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Type checking
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit checks

### Configuration Files

- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint rules and plugins
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.husky/` - Git hooks configuration

## Code Quality Principles

### 1. Automated Enforcement

- All coding standards enforced through automated tools
- Pre-commit hooks prevent non-compliant code
- CI/CD pipeline includes linting checks
- Zero tolerance for linting failures

### 2. Team Consistency

- Shared configuration files across all packages
- Consistent rules for all platforms
- Regular updates to linting rules
- Team agreement on rule changes

### 3. IDE Integration

- ESLint and Prettier extensions required
- Auto-format on save enabled
- Real-time error highlighting
- Consistent development experience

## Standards Categories

### Code Formatting

- Handled by Prettier
- Consistent indentation and spacing
- Line length and wrapping rules
- Quote and semicolon preferences

### Code Quality

- Handled by ESLint
- Unused variable detection
- Import/export organization
- Complexity and maintainability rules

### Type Safety

- Handled by TypeScript
- Strict type checking enabled
- No implicit any types
- Proper interface definitions

### Security

- Security-focused ESLint plugins
- Vulnerability detection
- Safe coding practices
- Dependency scanning

## Platform-Specific Standards

### Shared Package

- Strictest linting rules
- Maximum code reuse requirements
- Cross-platform compatibility checks
- Performance optimization rules

### Desktop (Electron)

- Electron-specific linting rules
- Node.js security best practices
- Main/renderer process separation
- System integration standards

### Mobile (React Native)

- React Native specific rules
- Platform-specific code organization
- Performance optimization for mobile
- Accessibility standards

### Web (React)

- Web-specific linting rules
- Browser compatibility checks
- SEO and performance standards
- Progressive web app requirements

## Documentation Standards

### Code Comments

- JSDoc for public APIs
- Inline comments for complex logic
- TODO comments with issue tracking
- Deprecation notices with migration paths

### README Files

- Package-level documentation
- Setup and usage instructions
- API documentation links
- Contributing guidelines

## Testing Standards

### Test Organization

- Co-located test files
- Descriptive test names
- Comprehensive coverage requirements
- Mock and fixture standards

### Test Quality

- Unit test requirements
- Integration test coverage
- E2E test scenarios
- Performance test benchmarks

## Performance Standards

### Bundle Size

- Maximum bundle size limits
- Code splitting requirements
- Tree shaking optimization
- Asset optimization rules

### Runtime Performance

- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU usage optimization
- Network request optimization
- Caching strategy implementation

## Security Standards

### Input Validation

- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection measures
- CSRF protection implementation

### Authentication

- JWT token handling
- Secure storage practices
- Session management
- Password security requirements

## Maintenance Standards

### Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking
- Version pinning strategies

### Code Review

- Required for all changes
- Automated checks before review
- Performance impact assessment
- Security review for sensitive changes

## Tools Configuration

### ESLint Configuration

```javascript
// .eslintrc.js example structure
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    "@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended",
    "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended",
  ],
  rules: {
    // Project-specific overrides
  },
};
```

### Prettier Configuration

```javascript
// .prettierrc example
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews

- Monthly linting rule reviews
- Team feedback collection
- Tool effectiveness assessment
- Rule optimization based on project needs

### Tool Updates

- Regular tool version updates
- New rule adoption
- Deprecated rule removal
- Performance impact monitoring

Remember: The goal is to maintain high code quality through automated tools while keeping the development process smooth and efficient.
